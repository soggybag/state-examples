# React State Examples

Some examples using state and react components.

## Getting started

1. Download or clone this Repo.
1. `npm install`
1. `npm start`

## Challenges

This exercise explores components and state.

The default app defines two components: `Counter` and `Title`.

The `Title` component is defined with a function. It takes a single prop: `text` which it displays. This `props.text` comes from outside and component updates/renders when the value changes _externally._

The `Counter` component contains a `Title` and a button. This component is defined as Class that extends `Component`. This allows `Counter` to hold values on `state` _internally._ When values on state change the component updates/renders.

**Challenge 1** Currently clicking the button increments the count by adding 1. Your job is to get the count to increment by 5 with each click.

**Challenge 2** Components are great because they are reusable. Make two copies of the `<Counter />` component. You should have three counters each of which keeps track of it's own value for `state.count`.

**Challenge 3** While counting in ones is good it would better if each counter counter could increment by _any value._

Make the first `Counter` **increment by 1** with each click.

Make the second `Counter` **increment by 3** with each click.

make the third `Counter` **increment by 5** with each click.

**Solve this problem without making a new component!** use the existing `Counter` component.

> Hint: Use props

**Challenge 4** Display the amount that each counter increments next to the label on the button. Each of the buttons should look something like:

- [ Count 1 ]
- [ Count 3 ]
- [ Count 5 ]

**Challenge 5** While having each button with it's own counter was good the needs of our app have changed. We now need to display a **single count** with three buttons that each increment the count by 1, 3, and 5.

To do this you'll need to _lift up state_. Previously state existed in _each_ of the Counter components. Now state will have exist _only_ in the Component that is the parent of the buttons.

In a simple solution the App Component would now own `count` on state. In a more advanced solution You could create a new Component that would own `count` on state and also own the increment buttons.

After "lifting state" above the Counter Buttons, you'll want to remove state from these.

With this arrangement there should be a single `count` which cna be incremented by any of the buttons.

### Stretch Challenges

Here are some optional challenges you can try.

**Challenge 6** Make a button that only appears when the count reaches 10 or more. Make this a component. It should say "Buy Factory".

Your app should look something like:

- 23
- [ Count 1 ]
- [ Count 3 ]
- [ Count 5 ]
- [ Buy Factory ]

**Challenge 7**
